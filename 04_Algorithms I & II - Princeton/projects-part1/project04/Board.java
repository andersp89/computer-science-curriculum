/**
 * Write a program to solve the 8-puzzle problem 
 * (and its natural generalizations) using the A* search algorithm.
 * 
 * The problem. 
 * The 8-puzzle is a sliding puzzle that is played on 
 * a 3-by-3 grid with 8 square tiles labeled 1 through 8, plus a 
 * blank square. The goal is to rearrange the tiles so that 
 * they are in row-major order, using as few moves as possible. 
 * 
 * You are permitted to slide tiles either horizontally or 
 * vertically into the blank square. The following diagram 
 * shows a sequence of moves from an initial board (left) 
 * to the goal board (right).
 * 
 * Board data type.
 * To begin, create a data type that 
 * models an n-by-n board with sliding tiles. 
 * Implement an immutable data type Board with the following API.
 * 
 * Constructor:
 * May assume that the constructor receives an n-by-n array containing
 * the n^2 integers between 0 and n^2-1. Where 0 is blank. 2 <= n < 128.
 * 
 * String representation:
 * The toString() method returns a string composed of n+1 lines.
 * First line: board size n.
 * The remaining n lines contains the n-by-n grid of tiles in row-major order,
 * using 0 to designate the blank square.
 * 
 * Hamming and Manhattan distances.  
 * To measure how close a board is to the goal board, we define two notions of distance. 
 * _The Hamming distance betweeen a board and the goal board is 
 * the number of tiles in the wrong position. 
 * _The Manhattan distance between a board and the goal board is
 * the sum of the Manhattan distances (sum of the vertical and 
 * horizontal distance) from the tiles to their goal positions.
 * 
 * Comparing two boards for eqaulity 
 * Two boards are equal if they are have the same size and their corresponding 
 * tiles are in the same positions. The equals() method is inherited from 
 * java.lang.Object, so it must obey all of Javaâ€™s requirements.
 * 
 * Neighboring boards
 * The neighbors() method returns an iterable containing the neighbors of the board. 
 * Depending on the location of the blank square, a board can have 2, 3, or 4 neighbors.
 * 
 * Unit testing
 * main() method test public methods
 * 
 * Performance requirements: all boards methods in n^2
