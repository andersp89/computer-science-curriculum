# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

Completed course [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa19/) by **UC Berkeley**. The course is focused on programming, not about how to use one particular programming language. It considers a series of techniques for controlling program complexity, such as functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming.

* **Week 1**: Functions, Names
* **Week 2**: Control, Higher-Order Functions, Environments
* **Week 3**: Iteration, Design, Function Examples
* **Week 4**: Recursion, Tree Recursion
* **Week 5**: Containers, Data Abstraction, Trees
* **Week 6**: Mutable Values, Mutable Functions, Iterators
